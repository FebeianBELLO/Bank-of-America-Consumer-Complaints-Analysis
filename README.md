Diversifying and improving customer communication channels, including social media, mobile apps, and online chat support, can lead to quicker resolution and improved customer satisfaction. Providing multiple avenues for customers to lodge complaints and seek assistance is crucial.

Encouraging customers to rate their satisfaction with the resolution process can offer actionable data.

Training should focus on empathy, problem-solving, and technical knowledge, providing representatives with the right tools and information to enhance overall customer service quality.

Establishing a robust monitoring and benchmarking system to track the performance of complaint resolution processes can help Bank of America continuously improve.
